5 concurrent users each doing 10 page hits
This is 100 page loads by 5 different concurrent users, each user is doing 10 sequential pages loads.
This represents a peak load of a website that gets about 50,000+ hits a month. Congratulations, your website / business / idea has made it (and no doubt is on its way up).

10 concurrent users each doing 10 page hits
This is 100 page loads by 10 different concurrent users, each user is doing 10 sequential pages loads.
This is where the load starts to really stress test the web-server, as 10 concurrent (simultaneous) users is a lot of traffic. Most websites will be lucky to see 1 or 2 users (visitors) a minuteâ€¦ So let me say it again, 10 users per second is a lot of traffic!

30 concurrent users each doing 20 page hits
This is 600 page loads by 30 different concurrent users, each user is doing 20 sequential pages loads.
This is the edge of what a non-cached WordPress setup will be able to handle without crashing or timing-out the web-server (and/or ab itself). This type of load represents an extremely active website or forum, the top 1%.

90 concurrent users each doing 30 page hits
This is 2700 page loads by 90 different concurrent users, each user is doing 30 sequential pages loads.
Only a fully cached (using mod_cache) Apache setup will be able to handle this type of a load. This represents some of the busiest sites on the net, and there is no hope of this not maxing out and crashing (if your settings are not just right) the web-server with a non-cached WordPress setup.
